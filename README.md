# ⚡ My AI Era: OCI Foundations to Pro 🤖✨

Welcome to the lab! 🧪 I'm Shama, and I'm currently hyper-focusing on mastering Artificial Intelligence via Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. No mid-life crisis here, just leveling up my tech stack. 💅✨

## 🏁 The Mission
Moving from "What is a Prompt?" to building full-scale RAG systems using OCI GenAI, Oracle Database 23ai, and LangChain. We're not just coding; we're creating the future. 🚀

## 🗺️ The Roadmap
- [ ] **Phase 1: OCI AI Foundations** 🏗️ (Building the base so the brain doesn't glitch)
- [ ] **Phase 2: OCI GenAI Professional** 🧠 (Deep diving into LLMs, Fine-tuning, and RAG)
- [ ] **Phase 3: Certification Secured** 🏆 (The ultimate flex)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack in my Bag
- **Languages:** Python 🐍 (Basic to Pro)
- **Cloud:** Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) ☁️
- **Frameworks:** LangChain & Oracle Database 23ai ⛓️
- **Vibe:** Consistent & Caffeine-fueled ☕
